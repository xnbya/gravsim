AiMIS
=====

An Inteplanetary Mechanics Interactive Simulatior
-------------------------------------------------

AiMIS is a program that models the gravitational interaction between multiple objects. It can be used to simulate various types of orbits, including geosynchronous ones. The simulations are in a 2 dimensional space, hence all of the objects will in effect move in one plane, which is quite similar to the motion of the planets in our solar system. It is written in C# and uses the OpenTK framework to draw the graphics with OpenGL.
